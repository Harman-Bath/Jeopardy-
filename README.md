# jeopardy
Started creating jeopardy using HTML5 and CSS.
Only created a non-functional login page as of yet - still an ongoing project. 

Added Spring and Thymeleaf to the project. Also added a HomeController class with the appropriate @GetMappings to navigate pages. 
Made the pages work with Thymeleaf as well.
